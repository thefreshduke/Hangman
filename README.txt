I also tried to find information on Google, which primarily led me to stackoverflow.com and dreamincode.net.
I'm not sure I truly understood anything I read on either site, but I would hesitate to deny any possibility of having derived ideas from what I saw.

I really enjoyed this assignment. It was challenging and even stumped me at times, but I never felt overwhelmed.
It helped that I played Hangman a lot growing up, so I simply had to convert the step-by-step actions into an algorithm.
I was able to plan and write the code mostly by myself, but everyone listed helped me refine my thought process in some way.
I struggled with converting my code into methods and used comments to clarify the purpose of each section.
Although I won't be able to convert everything into methods in time for the deadline, I will try to do so after my submission.
